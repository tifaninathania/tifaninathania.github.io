        <h1>Mixing Fonts</h1>
        <p> <i> Less is more </i> </p>
        <p> Enthusiasm for fonts often leads to enthusiasm for multiple fonts, and then the question: “How do I get better at <i>mixing fonts</i> in a document?”</p>
		<p> Mixing fonts is like mixing patterned shirts and ties—there aren’t blackletter rules. Some people have a knack for it; some don’t. </p>
		<p> Keep these principles in mind: </p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p> Mixing fonts is never a requirement—it’s an option. You can get plenty of mileage out of one font using variations based on <b> point size, bold or italic, small caps,</b> and so on. </p> 
			</li>
			
			<li> 
				<p> The rule of diminishing returns applies. Most documents can tolerate a second font. Few can tolerate a third. Almost none can tolerate four or more. (If you’re making a presentation, consider all your slides to be part of one document.) </p>
			</li>

				<p> See <b> bold or italic </b> for the difference between serif and sans serif fonts. </p>

			<li>
				<p> You can mix any two fonts that are identifiably different. If you’ve heard that you can only mix a serif font with a sans serif font, it’s not true. On the contrary, much like mixing colors, lower contrast between fonts can be more effective than higher contrast. </p> 
			</li>

				<p> For instance, you wouldn’t mix Palatino and Palatino Nova <b>(see palatino alternatives)</b> —the differences are too subtle. But I would consider mixing Lyon and Harriet, even though they’re both serif fonts. For inspiration, look at any American newspaper—typically, the <b>body text</b> and the headlines are both in serif fonts, but different ones. </p>
		
			<li>
				<p> Font mixing is most successful when each font has a consistent role in the document. In a <b>research memo</b>, try one font for body text and one font for <b>headings</b>. Or in a motion, try one font for things in the center of the document (body text and headings) and one font for things at the edges (line numbers, footer, and other miscellany). </p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p> It rarely works to have multiple fonts in a single paragraph. Better to restrict yourself to one font per paragraph, and change fonts only at paragraph breaks. </p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
				<p> Though I’m typically reluctant to endorse rote methods, this one works reliably: combine fonts by the same font designer. For instance, <b>harriet</b> and <b>alright sans</b>, both designed by Jackson Cavanaugh, would mix well. For that matter, so would <b>concourse</b> and <b>equity</b>, both designed by me. </p>
			</li>
